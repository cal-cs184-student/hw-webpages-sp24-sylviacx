<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p> We implemented several rasterization techniques that translate SVG files onto a display. Through these exercises, we gained a lot of experience on various sampling techniques, mipmaps, 
    and transforms. This homework was especially interesting because we were building new techniques on top of previous implemetations of simpler methods. It was interesting to see how minor 
    bugs in earlier tasks would go unnoticed, but would completely break later tests. It was interesting to see how these minor bugs gave almost no indication of 
    problems in the test images, but would completeley break later tasks. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p> First, we checked the winding direction of the triangle vertices and swapped the direction accordingly if needed. Then, we calculated the bounding box containing the input triangle so that
    we could optimize the runtime by iterating through all the pixels within that box. </p>

<p> We checked if each pixel was inside the triangle by passing the midpoint of each pixel into our helper function is_inside_triangle(). This function used the Three Line Test we covered in 
	Lecture 2 to check if the given point was inside all 3 edges of the triangle. For each edge (x0, y0), (x1, y1), and (x2, y2), we checked if the following condition was true:</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
	<span style="font-size: 20px;"><b>L(px, py) >= - (px - X<sub>i</sub>) * (y1 - Y<sub>i</sub>) + (y - Y<sub>i</sub>) * (x1 - X<sub>i</sub>)</b></span>
</div>

<p> If this condition was true for all 3 edges, we filled the pixel with the input color. On each pixel, we are computing a constant number of arithmetic operations in our is_inside_triangle 
	function, so the runtime of processing each pixel is O(1). We process bw * bh pixels, where bw and bh are the width and heigh respectively of the bounding box. Thus, the overall runtime
	of our algorithm is O(bw * bh), which is at least as efficient as sampling only within the bounding box of the triangle. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

<p> In this part, we had to make a few modifications to our algorithm in Part 1 in order to support supersampling. In supersampling, instead of taking a single point within a pixel as reference, 
	we need to take <code>sample_rate</code> number of points within each pixel. This gives us more information to determine the color value of a pixel by averaging from multiple points within a 
	single pixel. Thus, if for example, a pixel is cut in half by the edge of a triangle, with half the pixel inside the triangle and the other half outside, supersampling will average the color 
	from both the inside and the outside of the triangle. This smooths out jagged edges (jaggies) by making edges appear less distinct. </p>
	
<p> In order to implement this, we essentially needed to upscale the original image by a factor of sqrt(sample_rate), fill the sample buffer, then downsample the sample buffer data into the frame 
	buffer by averaging sqrt(sample_size) x sqrt(sample_size) size sections from the sample buffer into single frame buffer pixels. To make the sample buffer the appropriate size, we modified 
	set_sample_rate(), set_framebuffer_target(), and fill_pixel() to support a sample buffer of size <code>width * height * sample_rate</code>. In order to upscale the original image, we needed 
	to add more looping logic in rasterize_point() to iterate <code>sqrt(sample_rate)</code> times in the x and y direction of each point, sampling a total of <code>sample_rate</code> points within 
	each pixel. Then, we also modified <code>resolve_to_framebuffer()</code> to translate from the higher dimensional <code>sample_buffer</code> to the <code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code>. Instead of 
	a 1:1 pixel translation, to determine the color of a certain frame buffer pixel we needed to loop through all supersampled points taken from that pixel and average their color values.</p>
