    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p> We implemented a cloth simulation and several different shading models. 
      We represented our cloth through a mesh grid of points and springs, then calculated the force enacted on each point by springs and other factors to calculate how each point in the cloth would fall.
      We then handled collision with a sphere, a plane, and the cloth itself.
      Finally we implemented diffuse, blinn-phong, bump, displacement, and mirror shaders to visualize all sorts of different textures.
      This homework was especially interesting because it's our first assignment working with moving objects and it was really fun to see how each shader model completely changed the material of our objects.

    <p>
      With a very low ks = 1, the cloth looks much more fluid and stretchy, almost like a very thin silk. 
      As it falls, it bounces back up a little bit when pulled by the pinned corners.
      The cloth forms many creases at the top, and the 2 pinned corners seem to stretch out from gravity.
      Even at rest, it constantly ripples, especially at edges and creases.
      With a very high ks = 700, the cloth looks much more rigid, like a typical cotton cloth.
      It forms only 2 creases at the top, and its pinned corners are not as stretched out by gravity.
      At rest, it stays still and doesn't ripple like with ks = 1.

    <p>
      With a very low density = 1, we see a similar result as observed with high ks, except the cloth is even more rigid.
      Low density causes 1 crease to form at the top, and its pinned corners are not very stretched by gravity.
      At rest, the cloth stays still and doesn't ripple.
      With a very high density = 700, we see a similar result as observed with low ks, like a very thin silk.
      As it falls, it bounces back up a little bit when pulled by the pinned corners.
      Many creases form at the top, and the pinned corners are once again stretched by gravity.
      At rest, the cloth constantly ripples, especially at edges and creases.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader programs are lighting computation algorithms that, instead of being ran on CPUs, are ran parallelistically on GPUs.
      This makes computation must faster, since doing millions of ray computations on a CPU is costly and causes visual lag.
      The first part of a shader program is the vertex shader, which transforms the object's vertices from its coordinate system to the visual scene's coordinate system.
      Essentially, the vertex shader sets up the object structure and vertex positions in the scene's coordinate system.
      The second part of the shader program is the fragment shader, which takes in the transformed vertices and uses mathematical lighting models to generate color values for each pixel.
      It is here that cool effects like glossiness and bumpy textures can be created.
    </p>


    <blockquote><b>
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. 
    Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model combines ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to create a glossy lighting effect. 
      The equation for Blinn-Phong is shown below:
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <span style="font-size: 20px;"><b>L = k<sub>a</sub>I<sub>a</sub> + k<sub>d</sub>(I/r<sup>2</sup>)max(0, n⋅l) + k<sub>s</sub>(I/r<sup>2</sup>)max(0, n⋅h)<sup>p</sup></b></span>
      </div>
      Ambient light is calculated through <b>k<sub>a</sub>I<sub>a</sub></b>. 
      This defines the light levels in the scene where light coming directly from the light source does not hit.
      Diffuse light is calculated through <b>k<sub>d</sub>(I/r<sup>2</sup>)max(0, n⋅l)</b>. 
      This light is cast uniformaly in all directions from the light source and is what gives objects a matte lighting texture.
      Specular light is calculated through <b>k<sub>s</sub>(I/r<sup>2</sup>)max(0, n⋅h)<sup>p</sup></b>. 
      This light forms highlights by reflecting light in one direction and is what gives objects a glossy lighting texture.

    <p>
      In bump mapping, we first calculated the cross product of the tangent and normal vectors. 
      Then we calculated the differential from adding 1/w to the u coordinate and adding 1/h to the v coordinate and scaling them by u_height_scaling and u_normal_scaling.
      Finally we transformed the normal vector by multiplying it all together.
      Displacement mapping does the same thing, except it also modifies the vertex coordinates so that the object phsyically changes, not just the lighting values.
    
      With the less coarse mesh, the displacement bumps on the sphere look much more jagged, almost to the point where they don't match what the bump texture looks like.
      With the coarser mesh, the displacement bumps are much less extreme and actually look like they follow what the bump texture looks like.

  <p>
    We worked collaboratively, in person on the entire coding section of the project.
    For the writeup, Sylvia did part 1, 2, and 5 while Artem did parts 3 and 4.
